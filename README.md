# Data structures II
 
 These are the projects that i made in the Data structures II course. 
 
 The T1 project is the implementation of AVL tree to Generic types of data.

 The T2 project is the implementation of the red black tree.

 The T3 project is the implementation of the Huffman algorithm to compress and decompress text files.

 All the projects are made in C language and structured like libraries. The .h file contains the header of the functions, the main.c is the client file and it uses the functions implemented in the .c file corresponding to the project (AVL.c, ARN.c or Huffman.c). All the files were documented (commented) to describe what each function and each part of the code do.
 
 Each project also has a makefile to compile all the project easily. Just go to the directory with the makefile and run the command "make" in terminal. Then, just execute the compiled file.
